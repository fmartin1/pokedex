# Pokedex Rest Client

This project was proposed by my friends at Nearsoft to help me nail Spring concepts. Specially those related to creating RESTful services.

However I've started updating it to be a little more modern, and easier to understand.

First I added Spring Boot support, and then caching.

I'm not nearly half done with this, since the scariest part is still in front of me, the horrible horrible frontend.

I plan to procrastinate it as much as possible.

Since this is a learning project, I don't think Pull Requests are of much use to me, hopefully, however, you can use this to practice and learn yourself.
